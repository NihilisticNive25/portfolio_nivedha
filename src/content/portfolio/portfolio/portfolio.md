I wanted to build a porfolio to showcase my skills, experience and show some of my work, rather than just type over a resume. This site is build using Gatsby due to it's several benefits. I was able to add multiple contents and use Gatsbyâ€™s internal GraphQL API to pull content into my templates. It also has Dark mode for the night owls.
